## Hello, my name is Timothy ðŸ‘‹ 

### I am a creative frontend developer with a passion for UX/UI design based in Brussels, Belgium.

After working 5+ years in the tourism industry, I've decided to undertake a professional retraining, and landed in an intensive Web Development bootcamp.

Due to my background as a photographer and music composer, I found myself being extremely passionate about frontend development and creative opportunities it offers.

Now, I love to create aesthetic and responsive websites using modern technologies.
